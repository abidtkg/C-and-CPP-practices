1. <b>char</b> -> is a character type data. As like A,b,C,d,e,f. In the char it can contain only one character data "a" or "B" orsomething like this. To get multiple data into the Char we need to declare char variableName[] = "we can write like this now!";
2. <b>%s</b> -> %s is a placeholder, example: printf("%s\n", variableName);here %s will replaced by variableName.
3. <b>%d</b> -> %d help to print the integer numbers. it's same as the point 2. ex: printf("%d\n", variableName);
4. <b>\n</b> -> \n command is for printing new line. ex: printf("this is line one \n"); printf("this is line 2");
